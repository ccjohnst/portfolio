# My second porfolio

The second version of my portfolio, which has a more modern user interface than my previous portfolio.

## Rationale

This was my third personal project using Gatsby, so at this point I felt comfortable using it as my sub-framework of choice for my updated portfolio.

My reasoning behind using Gatsby was that it has great SEO, fantastic plug-in support and deploys easily to popular hosing platforms.

## Deployment

To deploy my portfolio, I decided to use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) due to the excellent form submission handling provided by [Netlify Forms](https://www.netlify.com/products/forms/).

## Getting started

```
nvm use 12.13.1 # IMPORTANT DUE TO COMPATABILITY ERRORS WITH RECENT NODE VERSIONS
git clone https://github.com/ccjohnst/portfolio
cd portfolio
npm install
npm start
```

## Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)
- [node-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass)
- [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
- [React Obfuscate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-obfuscate) - to obfuscate the email address on the contact icon.
